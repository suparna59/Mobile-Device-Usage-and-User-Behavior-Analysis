# Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior Analysis

This project explores mobile device usage patterns using data visualization techniques in Tableau. We analyze app usage time, screen-on duration, battery drain, and data consumption across user demographics and device models.

**Key Metrics:**
- Avg. App Usage Time: 271 min/day
- Avg. Data Usage: 930 MB/day
- Avg. Screen-On Time: 5 hours/day
- Avg. Battery Drain: 1,525 mAh/day
